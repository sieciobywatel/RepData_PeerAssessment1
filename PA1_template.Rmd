## Loading and preprocessing the data

```
data <- read.csv('activity.csv', header = TRUE)
clean <- na.omit(data)
```
totals <- tapply(clean$steps, clean$date, FUN = sum, na.rm = TRUE)

# histogram
hist(totals)

# calculate mean and median
mn <- mean(totals, na.rm=TRUE)
md <- median(totals, na.rm=TRUE)

```

# What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
The mean of steps taken per day is `mn` and median is `md`

```

# That's all, folks! (forgot about assignment... 10 minuts to deadline)
## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
